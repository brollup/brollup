# Valtype
Cube employs five specialized value types to minimize Bitcoin block space consumption, thereby optimizing data availability (DA) efficiency. The protocol is designed to ensure that transaction summary data is encoded in a highly compact form before being published in the `Payload` field of on-chain rollup state transitions.

The value types are defined as follows:

| Value Type           | Description                                                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AtomicVal            | A highly compact integer representation ranging from 0 to 255.                  |
| ShortVal             | A flexible integer representation ranging from 0 to 4,294,967,295.              |
| MaybeCommon ShortVal | A possibly common `ShortVal`.                                                   |
| LongVal              | A scalable integer representation ranging from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. |
| MaybeCommon LongVal  | A possibly common `LongVal`.                                                    |

## AtomicVal
`AtomicVal` is a highly compact unsigned integer representation ranging from 0 to 255. It dynamically determines the number of bits it needs to collect based on an upper bound.

| AtomicVal Tiers | Description                        | Upper Bound Range | Bitsize |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------------------|---------|
| b1              | Represents values from 0 to 1.     | 0 <= x <= 1       | 1 bit   |
| b2              | Represents values from 0 to 3.     | 1 <= x <= 3       | 2 bits  |
| b3              | Represents values from 0 to 7.     | 3 <= x <= 7       | 3 bits  |
| b4              | Represents values from 0 to 15.    | 7 <= x <= 15      | 4 bits  |
| b5              | Represents values from 0 to 31.    | 15 <= x <= 31     | 5 bits  |
| b6              | Represents values from 0 to 63.    | 31 <= x <= 63     | 6 bits  |
| b7              | Represents values from 0 to 127.   | 63 <= x <= 127    | 7 bits  |
| b8              | Represents values from 0 to 255.   | 127 <= x <= 255   | 8 bits  |

`AtomicVal` is used for encoding very small values, such as `Contract` call methods.

For an average `Contract` with four callable methods, `AtomicVal` falls into the b2 tier, and consume only 2 bits. Compared to traditional EVM `function selectors`, which use 4 bytes, this results in a savings of 30 bits per `Entry` in the `Payload`, translating to approximately ~0.93 vBytes in block space.

## ShortVal

`ShortVal` is a compact unsigned integer representation ranging from 0 (inclusive) to 4,294,967,295 (inclusive). It is used for representing small values such as contract or account registry indexes. `ShortVal` consumes a varying amount of bit space.

| ShortVal Tiers | Description                                | Bitsize |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| U8             | Represents values from 0 to 255.           | 10 bits |
| U16            | Represents values from 0 to 65,535.        | 18 bits |
| U24            | Represents values from 0 to 16,777,215.    | 26 bits |
| U32            | Represents values from 0 to 4,294,967,295. | 34 bits |

## MaybeCommon ShortVal

`MaybeCommon ShortVal` is a possibly common `ShortVal` representation. This adds one bit of overhead to the bit size of `ShortVal` to determine whether the encoded value is common.

A common value of `1000`, for instance, would fall into the U16 tier of `ShortVal` and consume 18 bits. When represented with `MaybeCommon ShortVal`, it consumes only 7 bits, resulting in a savings of 11 bits per `Entry` in the `Payload`, translating to approximately ~0.34 vBytes of block space savings.

| MaybeCommon ShortVal Tiers  | Description                                | Bitsize |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| Common                      | Represents a list of 64 common values.     | 7 bits  |
| Uncommon U8                 | Represents values from 0 to 255.           | 11 bits |
| Uncommon U16                | Represents values from 0 to 65,535.        | 19 bits |
| Uncommon U24                | Represents values from 0 to 16,777,215.    | 27 bits |
| Uncommon U32                | Represents values from 0 to 4,294,967,295. | 35 bits |

## LongVal

`LongVal` is a compact unsigned integer representation ranging from 0 (inclusive) to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (inclusive). It is used for representing large values such as contract parameters. `LongVal` consumes a varying amount of bit space.

| U64          | Represents values from 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.| 67 bits |

## MaybeCommon LongVal

`MaybeCommon LongVal` is a possibly common `LongVal` representation. This adds one bit of overhead to the bit size of `LongVal` to determine whether the encoded value is common.

| MaybeCommon LongVal Tiers | Description                                            | Bitsize|
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------|
